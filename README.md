# INFO 441 - Dawg Network

# Project Description
Our team plans to build a real-time networking chat application where users can login / signup, invite other users, like posts, and post comments on each others' profiles.

Our main audience will specifically be UW students, staff, mentors, advisors, professors, but outside of UW it will include recruiters/employers. Basically, the main audience using this application will be anyone affiliated with UW but accessible by outside employers. 

Our audience wants to use our application to be able to connect with mentors, professors and recruiters.

We want to build this application because we feel like UW students sometimes have a hard time trying to communicate and coordinate with professional/alumnis for coffee chats and we see this as a solution to this problem space.

# Technical Description
- Client: 
  - Handles input (Profile creation, updates, chat messages etc.)
  - First iteration will be done using solely HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript.
  - Time permitting, we plan to convert to React.js for a better, more efficient, and easy to update user experience.
- Server: 
  - Processes inputs from the client
  - Coordinates between the client and database to provide the correct data to the user
  - Authentication will also be handled here. This will be done using Azure.
- Database: 
  - Mongodb (NoSQL) will be used to store data.
